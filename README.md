This is a program I wrote during my first semester of Lewis-Clark State College in my CS213 class. Opens a .dat file and splits up each task according to how long it takes For example if there is a process that takes 3 seconds it will go into Queue 1. If the process is longer than 3 seconds it will go into queue 2 and if the process is longer than 100 seconds it will go into queue 3.

ATTENTION: 
I did not code Queue2 or QueueNode but I do understand them
